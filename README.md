**a VHDL microprocessor**

This microprocessor was made for the Computer Architecture and Organization course offered at Federal University of Technology — Paraná (UTFPR), by Computer Engineering students @annaravazzi and @Maria0419.

The project was based on the Intel MCS-51 (Intel 8051) assembly, with 15 bits instructions.
